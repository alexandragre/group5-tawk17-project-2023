# Cocktail recipe website

With an extensive database of drink recipes, Sipper is the ultimate location for cocktail enthusiasts and those looking to up their drink game. 

The project is a drink recipe website where users can browse and share recipes for a variety of cocktails and mocktails. The website has a user-friendly interface.
The website features multiple sections, including:
Home page: The main landing page for the website, featuring recipes of trending cocktails. 
My account: This section will allow registered users to manage their account settings and submit their own recipes to the website. 

The target users of the website are anyone from age 20 and up. They are very interested in sharing their favorite drink recipes or getting inspiring recipes from others. It could be for a party or a dinner. It could include people that are more extroverted and social but could as well include people that are introverted and wants to have a relaxing time. 

The different types of users are: 

Registered user: These are users who have created an account on the website. They can create their own recipes and save for inspiration. 

Admin user: They can read and submit their own recipes, view other's recipes and edit/delete their own and others recipes.

## Lessons Learned

Working with an external API proved to be a big problem for us throughout the project. Unfortunately, it took us much longer than expected to fully understand the API's complexities because of a misunderstanding of its operation. But we were able to get beyond this difficulty and effectively incorporate the API into our project thanks to our persistence and proactive communication with our teacher Linus.

Considering this experience, there are a number of actions we would take differently if we were to start the project now. If we had more time, we would give priority to the following improvements:

1. Images in Form/User Profiles: We would add the option to upload and display images within the form and user profiles in order to improve the form's aesthetic appeal and user experience. This feature will not only improve the application's visual appeal overall, but it would also give users a more unique and interesting experience.

2. Implementing Input Validation: We would increase the system's dependability by putting in place extensive input validation procedures because we understand how important data integrity is. We would increase the application's general resilience and accuracy by making sure that inputs cannot be left empty or contain inaccurate data.

3. Addressing CSS flaws on Input Fields: We would allow time to fix any current CSS inconsistencies or flaws on the input fields as part of our commitment to delivering a polished and aesthetically pleasing experience. The styling of these components might be improved to produce a more unified and aesthetically pleasing design, improving the application's overall professionalism and usefulness.

By incorporating these improvements, we would demonstrate our dedication to continuous enhancement and refinement, resulting in a more comprehensive and user-centric solution.
